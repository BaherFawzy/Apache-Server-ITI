# Apache Server Project

This repository contains the configuration and setup for an Apache HTTP Server environment, developed as part of an ITI project. The aim is to deploy and manage a secure, scalable, and reliable web server.

## Features

- **Robust Apache HTTP Server configuration** for serving web content.
- **Secure implementation** with SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communication.
- **Customizable virtual hosts** for hosting multiple websites on the same server.
- **Enhanced logging and monitoring** for server activities.
- **Documentation** for setup and troubleshooting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use or contribute to this project, ensure you have:

- A Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
- Basic knowledge of Apache configuration.
- Access to a domain or IP for server testing.
- Installed tools:
  - Apache HTTP Server (`apache2` or `httpd`)
  - OpenSSL (for SSL certificates)
  - Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaherFawzy/Apache-Server-ITI.git
   cd Apache-Server-ITI
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Verify the server is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl status apache2  
   systemctl status httpd    
   ```

### Usage

- **Virtual Hosts**: Edit the `conf/virtual-hosts.conf` file to add your domain configurations.
- **SSL Certificates**: Place your SSL certificates in the `certs/` directory and update the `conf/ssl.conf` file.
- Restart the Apache server after any changes:
  ```bash
  systemctl restart apache2  
  systemctl restart httpd     
  ```
